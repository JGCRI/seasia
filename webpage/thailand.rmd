# Executive Summary
<!-------------------------->
<!-------------------------->
<p align="center"> <img src="images/divider.png"></p>

* **Motivation:** Growth in power demand, renewables, and changes in policies and resource availability will require significant evolution in grid planning. Current planning tools usually focus on near-term horizon (i.e., 5- to 10-year), and are inadequate to support long-term decisions about grid capacity and distribution infrastructure upgrades. Tools for integrated energy planning with both near-term and long-term time horizons could help MEA plan future activities. 
* **Objectives:** Energy sector development and modernization is required to support continued urbanization and socioeconomic growth while reducing environmental impact. The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and Thammasat University will support Smart Grid planning for Bangkok by providing analysis and assessment of policy pathways using quantitative modeling approaches.
* **Approach:** Policy and technology trajectories will be modeled using the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM), an integrated assessment model. GCAM will be used to conduct the detailed assessment of energy and electricity system transition over time in different policy and technology scenarios, and provide high-resolution information on power demand from buildings, transportation, and industry as well as power generation technologies. We will also examine how digitalization and smart technologies could change electricity load and implications for electricity generation. 
* **Expected Outcomes:** Outputs of GCAM will be used to 	inform MEA’s effort on grid moderation, especially for long-term holistic, integrated energy planning. Results will inform policy recommendations.

# Introduction
<!-------------------------->
<!-------------------------->
<p align="center"> <img src="images/divider.png"></p>

Urbanization is driving rapid socioeconomic growth in Thailand, posing challenges for power grids as energy demand increases. Maintaining stability, reliability, and affordability of electricity will be especially challenging as Thailand works toward increasing their renewable energy (RE) shares and decreasing their environmental impact in line with international agreements. These goals and challenges were highlighted in Thailand’s 2018 Power Development Plan, which emphasized three priorities: energy security, economy, and environment. Energy security encompasses the need for stability of power generation, transmission, and distribution to support socioeconomic development and resilience to energy crises. Economic priorities are to promote low cost, high efficiency electricity generation, keeping prices low for consumers to further facilitate socioeconomic growth. Lastly, the plan emphasizes reducing environmental impact by supporting RE development and increasing efficiency in production and consumption.

The US-ASEAN Smart Cities Partnership (USASCP) uses innovative approaches across sectors to address the challenges and opportunities of energy development and urbanization in ASEAN Member States. The U.S. Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) is partnering with Thammasat University and the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) of Thailand to supplement Bangkok’s existing Smart City roadmap plans by providing integrated modeling and assessment capabilities. PNNL’s Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) is a global model integrating socioeconomics, energy, land use, water, and climate systems. PNNL, in collaboration with the Thammasat University modeling team, will use GCAM to assess the trajectories and outcomes of Smart City pathways for Bangkok and focus on the implications for the energy system in this analysis. The results of this analysis will aid MEA in their Smart City planning and implementation (Figure 2.1)

```

MEA supports energy sector plans for Bangkok by implementing Smart Grid development. The Smart Grid framework uses technological innovation to promote efficiency and reliability in power generation, transmission, and distribution systems while ensuring that the grid can both keep up with growing demand and accommodate RE expansion. Smart Grid approaches vary based on stakeholder needs but may include decentralizing generation, facilitating bidirectional data communication across the grid, integrating automation and monitoring, and providing opportunities for demand side management.

Thailand’s 2015 national Smart Grid master plan lays out plans to modernize its power sector through 2036 in line with the Smart Grid framework. In accordance with this national roadmap, MEA is developing Bangkok’s Smart Grid system by building capacity in the following areas:

* Monitoring and Control
* Data Analytics
* Supply Reliability
* Distributed Energy Resources Integration
* Green Energy
* Customer Engagement

Examples of planned technologies and policies include load forecasting, smart meter infrastructure, microgrids, energy storage systems, electric vehicle charging, and improved customer management systems, among others.

The collaboration between PNNL, Thammasat University, and MEA will support the long-term assessment of these plans and the analysis of their contribution to Thailand’s national socioeconomic growth, power development, and and environmental impact reduction goals (Figure 3.1). Based on results of the modeling approach detailed below, PNNL and Thammasat University will provide an analysis of pathways for grid modernization in Bangkok and possible trajectories towards a Bangkok Smart City in 2050.

# Methodology
<!-------------------------->
<!-------------------------->
<p align="center"> <img src="images/divider.png"></p>

Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are computational models that use links and feedbacks between socioeconomic and environmental systems to assess the implications of technology and policy choices in the context of global climate change. IAMs can provide a holistic approach to energy sector planning by considering multi-sector dynamics and global processes. GCAM, an IAM developed at PNNL, incorporates socioeconomics, energy, land use, water, and climate system (Figure 4.1). The model is global but can also be used to assess specific regions and fine scale processes; PNNL has developed both Thailand and Bangkok regions within the model for national and city level analyses. GCAM utilizes the most up to date data on population, GDP, technology characteristics, policies, resource availabilities, and other inputs. It has the detailed representation of energy technologies in different sectors, including electricity, buildings, transportation, industry, hydrogen production, and other energy supply sectors. The model produces both historical and projected future outputs based on this information. These outputs include greenhouse gas emissions, electricity prices, energy supply and demand, and other indicators at five-year time steps from a historical baseline year to the desired end year. PNNL and Thammasat University's modeling team will use GCAM to assess the implications of MEA’s Smart Grid plans for Bangkok through the year 2100.

```

PNNL’s assessment will encompass outcomes both on the national level and the city level, with the city level analysis including the three provinces served by MEA within the Bangkok metropolitan area. The map to the right shows these provinces (Figure 6.1.1): the green region includes Bangkok as well as the two other provinces served by MEA (Nonthaburi and Samut Prakan), while the shaded region includes only Bangkok itself, which is the area governed under the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA). For the city level analysis, results will be reported for each province individually as well as for the aggregated MEA service area.

<!-------------------------->
<p align="center"> <img src="images/divider.png"></p>

PNNL, in consultation with Thammasat University and MEA, will develop a set of scenarios for GCAM modeling based on Thailand’s national energy policies and plans as well as MEA’s Smart Grid plans for Bangkok. The impacts of policies and technologies will be assessed in GCAM through associated changes to markets, efficiency assumptions, energy generation shares, and other multi-sector factors. GCAM will predict future outcomes under each scenario; these outcomes may include greenhouse gas emissions, energy supply and demand, market penetration of different technologies, electricity prices, and other relevant indicators of policy impacts. The scenarios will include the following:

* **National Policies:** Scenario integrating existing national energy development plans and energy and emissions reduction policies.
* **Extended National Policies:** Scenario additionally including extended sustainable development measures implemented in other countries.
* **Bangkok Smart Energy:** Scenario integrating MEA's plans for Bangkok grid modernization and digitalization along with national policies. 
* **Carbon Neutral Thailand:** Scenario using most efficient pathway to national carbon neutrality by 2050.
* **Net-Zero Thailand:** Scenario using most efficient pathway to net-zero national CO2 emissions by 2065

<!-------------------------->
## Carbon Neutral and Net Zero
<!-------------------------->

**Net Zero and Carbon Neutral Thailand Scenarios:** At the 2021 United Nations climate change conference (COP26), Thailand’s prime minister announced the country’s goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 and net zero CO2 emissions by 2065. The carbon neutrality and net zero Thailand scenario represents the most economically efficient pathways for Thailand to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 and net zero CO2 emissions by 2065 given the energy policies included in the extended national policies scenario. This pathway will be found using GCAM’s solving capabilities. The outcomes of this scenario will provide insight into the role that the Bangkok metropolitan area will need play in Thailand’s decarbonization and highlight additional measures that may be needed.

<br>

<!-------------------------->
# Results
<!-------------------------->

PNNL and Thammasat University will present GCAM results showing relevant outcomes of the modeled scenarios up to the year 2100. These results could include greenhouse gas emissions, energy supply and demand, electricity price, and technology penetration, among other indicators. PNNL will work with MEA to determine which indicators are the most important to consider when assessing the impact of Smart Grid policies and technologies. 

<!-------------------------->
# Discussion
<!-------------------------->

PNNL, in collaboration with Thammasat University and MEA, will summarize and interpret the GCAM results for each policy pathway and impact indicator. This will include a discussion of how these results relate to MEA’s smart grid efforts and Bangkok’s current Smart City roadmaps and potential additional roadmaps. Based on the GCAM results, PNNL and Thammasat University will provide recommendations for policy pathways that best meet the goals of MEA’s Smart Grid development while making the desired contributions to Thailand’s holistic Smart City and power development objectives. The process of analysis and recommendations will involve engagement and feedback from MEA in order to provide information that best addresses MEA’s planning needs. Final results will be summarized in both a report and a peer-reviewed paper.
