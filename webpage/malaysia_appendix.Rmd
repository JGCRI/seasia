## Socioeconomics  {.tabset .tabset-pills}
<!-------------------------->
This section details the socioeconomic inputs used to define Malaysia and its subregions, Kuala Lumpur and "Rest of Malaysia," in GCAM. These metrics include population, GDP, and GDP per capita. Historical and projection data were used when available, otherwise data was calculated using the assumptions described below.

### Population

#### Historical Trends and Future Projections {-}

To estimate population values, we begin with annual data from the UN for Malaysia's population; we use historical data and a medium population projection scenario. For Kuala Lumpur, we use 2010 census data as our base year. We then calculate annual growth rates using the complete Malaysia dataset and apply these growth rates to extrapolate Kuala Lumpur population values. To find "Rest of Malaysia" values, we subtract Kuala Lumpur population from Malaysia values.

The plot below shows historical and future projected populations in Malaysia and Kuala Lumpur from the GCAM reference scenario from 1975 to 2100.  

``` {r pop-plot, echo = FALSE, fig.dim = c(8,4), fig.cap="Figure 9.1.1.1. **Historical and future projected population in Malaysia and Kuala Lumpur**"}
# Population
pop <- fread("../data/Malaysia/socioeconomic_inputs/gcam_query_pop.csv") %>% as_tibble()

## PLOT
population_plot <- pop %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, value)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~region, scales = "free") +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Population (millions)",
       title = "Population in Malaysia and Kuala Lumpur") ; population_plot


```

<br>

### GDP

#### Historical Trends and Future Projections {-}

To find GDP values, we begin with historical data of GDP MER in Malaysia from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service. We use future projections data from the SSP2 database. In a similar process to the population, we then calculate annual growth rates, which are applied to a base year for Kuala Lumpur. We use the 2020 GDP found in the Kuala Lumpur State Socioeconomic Report 2020. We find "Rest of Malaysia" values by subtracting Kuala Lumpur values from Malaysia.

The following graphs show GDP in billion 2005 USD for Malaysia and Kuala Lumpur.

``` {r gdp, echo = FALSE, fig.dim = c(8,4), fig.cap="Figure 9.1.2.1. **Historical and future projected GDP in Malaysia and Kuala Lumpur**"}
# GDP
gdp <- fread("../data/Malaysia/socioeconomic_inputs/gcam_query_gdp.csv") %>% as_tibble()

## PLOT
gdp_plot <- gdp %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, value)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~region, scales = "free") +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Billion (2005 USD)",
       title = "GDP in Malaysia and Kuala Lumpur") ; gdp_plot

```

<br>

### Per capita GDP

#### Historical Trends and Future Projections {-}

To find GDP per capita, we divide the above GDP values by the above population values. 

GDP per capita, in units of thousand 2005 USD, is shown below for Malaysia and Kuala Lumpur. 

``` {r gdp_pc, echo = FALSE, fig.dim = c(8,4), fig.cap="Figure 9.1.3.1. **Historical and future projected GDP per capita in Malaysia and Kuala Lumpur**"}
gdp_pc <- fread("../data/Malaysia/socioeconomic_inputs/gcam_query_pcgdp.csv") %>% as_tibble()

## PLOT
gdp_pc_plot <- gdp_pc %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, value)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~region, scales = "free") +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Thousand (2005 USD) per person",
       title = "GDP per capita in Malaysia and Kuala Lumpur") ; gdp_pc_plot


```

* Sectoral emissions for each scenario: After review of the KLCAP2050, the team noted some discrepancies in the data presented. A primary data need is emissions for at least the key years (2030, 2050) broken down by sector for each scenario (BAU, Council Led, and Integrated Approach). A detailed breakdown of the discrepancies can be provided upon request.
