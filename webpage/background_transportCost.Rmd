<b>Background - Transportation Cost</b></h3>

<p style='margin-left:1em;'>
In GCAM, the costs of different transportation technologies are comprised of two components: fuel costs and non-fuel costs. A transportation technology's fuel cost is determined by its vehicle fuel intensity as well as fuel price. The non-fuel costs encompass factors such as capital costs, operation and maintenance, and service costs. These non-fuel costs can be adjusted using the `input-cost` parameter. For more information on how transportation demand is modeled in GCAM, including cost calculations, see the transportation sections of the GCAM [Demand for Energy](https://jgcri.github.io/gcam-doc/demand_energy.html) documentation.
