# Executive Summary
<!-------------------------->
<!-------------------------->
<p align="center"> <img src="images/divider.png"></p>

* **Motivation:** Growth across the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in the past few decades has been driven by urban centers. Rapid urbanization can bring about negative societal impacts, although technological and digital solutions can be used to resolve these issues and enhance quality and accessibility of services. Smart city development projects, including carbon neutrality plans, are one such example. Furthermore, the region is at a high risk for climate hazards, and moving towards carbon neutrality allows for increased mitigation and adaptation efforts to combat these risks.  

* **Objectives:** The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) will collaborate with Kuala Lumpur on implementing low-carbon strategies to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and will support smart city development through capacity building. Using the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM), PNNL will analyze possible policy pathways and trajectories for Kuala Lumpur by applying quantitative modeling techniques.  

* **Approach:** The integrated assessment model GCAM is a modeling tool that represents the behavior of and interactions between five systems: energy, water, agriculture and land use, the climate, and the economy. GCAM will be used to analyze Kuala Lumpur’s existing carbon neutrality plans in a comprehensive manner by modeling inter-sectoral dynamics across several driving sectors, namely energy, buildings, transportation, and industry. PNNL will model different policy scenarios encompassing various socioeconomic, technical, and political factors to better understand the pathways to carbon neutrality in Kuala Lumpur.  

* **Expected Outcomes:** GCAM outputs will be used to guide a report detailing pathways and trajectories for Kuala Lumpur Carbon Neutrality by 2050 that will supplement existing city policies and plans. The report will include potential economic, environmental, and societal impacts of Kuala Lumpur’s carbon neutrality pathway, including abatement/investments costs and possible financing prospects, energy transitions, and air quality and health outcomes. Additionally, PNNL will lead workshops to train local experts on using GCAM and independently conducting analyses, who will then be able to continue further analysis of Kuala Lumpur’s pathways beyond 2050.

# Introduction & Motivation
<!-------------------------->
<!-------------------------->
<p align="center"> <img src="images/divider.png"></p>

Southeast Asia as a whole is experiencing a period of rapid growth and urbanization, which can present challenges for decarbonization efforts. The region also faces a heightened risk for climate impacts; in particular, Kuala Lumpur is vulnerable to the effects of high heat as well as increased flooding and droughts. Kuala Lumpur’s vision for approaching these issues is to transform the city into one that is sustainable and livable through its primary climate policies and plans: the Kuala Lumpur Low Carbon Society Blueprint 2030 (KLLCSBP2030), the draft Kuala Lumpur Structure Plan 2040 (KLSP2040), and the Kuala Lumpur Climate Action Plan 2050 (KLCAP2050). The most recent plan was developed to address and fulfill a carbon neutral target by 2050, increase resilience to climate hazards by 2050, incorporate a more inclusive approach to climate planning, and establish a governance structure that will collaborate with all stakeholders to reach climate action goals. Kuala Lumpur developed two scenarios under this plan, a Council-Led scenario aligned with targets from the KLLCSBP2030 and an Integrated Approach scenario highlighting the importance of collaboration across Kuala Lumpur, the Federal government, and other agencies in reaching emissions targets. 
The US-ASEAN Smart Cities Partnership (USASCP) uses innovative approaches across sectors to address the challenges and opportunities of energy development and urbanization in ASEAN Member States. In support of the USASCP, the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Energy Resources’ (ENR’s) Power Sector Program (PSP) is partnering with Kuala Lumpur to support existing plans to achieve carbon neutrality. The U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) will implement the program by collaborating with local partners, including the Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) and the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). PNNL will use its Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) to model various policy trajectories towards net zero by 2050 and corresponding economic, environmental, and social impacts.

# Objectives
<!-------------------------->
<!-------------------------->
<p align="center"> <img src="images/divider.png"></p>

MEA supports energy sector plans for Bangkok by implementing Smart Grid development. The Smart Grid framework uses technological innovation to promote efficiency and reliability in power generation, transmission, and distribution systems while ensuring that the grid can both keep up with growing demand and accommodate RE expansion. Smart Grid approaches vary based on stakeholder needs but may include decentralizing generation, facilitating bidirectional data communication across the grid, integrating automation and monitoring, and providing opportunities for demand side management.

Thailand’s 2015 national Smart Grid master plan lays out plans to modernize its power sector through 2036 in line with the Smart Grid framework. In accordance with this national roadmap, MEA is developing Bangkok’s Smart Grid system by building capacity in the following areas:

* Monitoring and Control
* Data Analytics
* Supply Reliability
* Distributed Energy Resources Integration
* Green Energy
* Customer Engagement

Examples of planned technologies and policies include load forecasting, smart meter infrastructure, microgrids, energy storage systems, electric vehicle charging, and improved customer management systems, among others.

The collaboration between PNNL and MEA will support the long-term assessment of these plans and the analysis of their contribution to Thailand’s socioeconomic growth and environmental impact reduction goals. Based on results of the modeling approach detailed below, PNNL will provide an analysis of pathways for grid modernization in Bangkok and possible trajectories towards a Bangkok Smart City in 2050.

<br>

<!-------------------------->
<!-------------------------->
# Approach
<!-------------------------->
<!-------------------------->
<p align="center"> <img src="images/divider.png"></p>

Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are computational models that use links and feedbacks between socioeconomic and environmental systems to assess the implications of technology and policy choices in the context of global climate change. IAMs can provide a holistic approach to energy sector planning by considering multi-sector dynamics and global processes. GCAM, an IAM developed at PNNL, incorporates socioeconomics, energy, land use, water, and climate system (Figure 1). The model is global but can also be used to assess specific regions and fine scale processes; PNNL has developed both Thailand and Bangkok regions within the model for national and city level analyses. GCAM utilizes the most up to date data on population, GDP, technology characteristics, policies, resource availabilities, and other inputs. It has the detailed representation of energy technologies in different sectors, including electricity, buildings, transportation, industry, hydrogen production, and other energy supply sectors. The model produces both historical and projected future outputs based on this information. These outputs include greenhouse gas emissions, electricity prices, energy supply and demand, and other indicators at five-year time steps from a historical baseline year to the desired end year. PNNL will use GCAM to assess the implications of MEA’s Smart Grid plans for Bangkok through the year 2100.

<!-------------------------->
# Scenarios {.tabset}
<!-------------------------->
<!-------------------------->
<p align="center"> <img src="images/divider.png"></p>

PNNL, with input from DBKL, will develop a set of GCAM scenarios based on the KLCAP2050 and other relevant policies and plans. These scenarios will outline possible outcomes of various policies. Key indicators may include greenhouse gas emissions, _________________. *TODO* 

* **BAU:** Baseline scenario based on existing policies only, with no additional actions. This will serve as a comparison for the remaining scenarios to assess the magnitude of outcomes.
* **Council-Led:** Scenario driven by strategies and actions that are ambitious and achievable within the authority of KLCH, including the implementation of all National policies.
* **Integrated Approach:** Scenario relying on an integrated approach with KLCH, the Federal government, and other agencies, highlighting the potential emissions reductions that could occur should all parties align.
* **Carbon Neutral Malaysia and Kuala Lumpur:** Scenario using the most efficient pathway to net zero CO~2~ emissions by 2050 at the national and city levels.


<!-------------------------->
## Council-Led
<!-------------------------->

**Council-Led Scenario:** In this scenario, KLCH has the authority to implement measures to achieve carbon emissions reductions. The scenario will largely be achieved through existing actions outlined in the KLLCSBP2030 and Federal policies and plans, including the National Renewable Energy Policy and Action Plan, the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan, the National Transport Policy, and publicly declared renewable energy targets. 

Note that this scenario _does not_ meet Kuala Lumpur's benchmark targets for 2030 or 2050; this is due to the lack of power and capacity for KLCH to implement more ambitious actions. Key remaining emissions will come from the following sectors: residential, commercial and institutional buildings, industrial energy, and on-road transportation.

The table below summarizes the policies encompassed by the Council-Led scenario. **UPDATE**

```{r, results = 'show', eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(pander)
myTable = data.frame(
    Sector     = c("Energy Supply",
                  "Transportation",
                  "Buildings",
                  "Industry"),
    Policies = c("* Power Development Plan 2018-2037 (bound capacity)\

                 "* Vehicle emissions standards\
                 \n * Emissions-based excise tax structure",
                 "* Building Energy Codes enforcement",
                 "* Energy Efficiency Resource Standards")
    ) 
pander::pander(myTable, keep.line.breaks = TRUE, style = "grid", justify = 'left', split.tables=Inf, caption = "Table 1. Policies included in the Mandatory National Policies scenario.")
```


<!-------------------------->
<!-------------------------->
## Integrated Approach
<!-------------------------->
<!-------------------------->

**Integrated Approach Scenario:** This scenario explores the potential carbon emissions reductions that could occur with strong collaboration across different stakeholders. Kuala Lumpur could be an advocate for such solutions, but the measures outlined in this scenario involve policy shifts at the Federal level.

Even if all scenario targets are met, Kuala Lumpur would still have residual emissions in situations where no mitigation technology exists or where a low-emissions alternative is technically or economically non-viable in the near-term. Top sources include: solid waste, commercial and institutional buildings, and on-road transportation.

The table below summarizes the policies encompassed by the Integrated Approach scenario. **UPDATE**

```{r, results = 'show', eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(pander)
myTable = data.frame(
    Sector     = c("Energy Supply",
                  "Transportation",
                  "Buildings & Industry"),
    Policies = c("* Power Development Plan 2018-2037 (bound capacity + target capacity)\
                 \n * Renewable and Alternative Energy Development Plan 2018-2037 (bound capacity + target capacity)",
                 "* Measures to promote EV use\
                 \n * Eco-driving promotion\
                 \n * Public transit expansion\
                 \n Electric Vehicle Roadmap to increase electric proportion of vehicles in manufacturing",
                 "* Voluntary energy efficiency labeling\
                 \n * Subsidies for equipment upgrades")
    ) 
pander::pander(myTable, keep.line.breaks = TRUE, style = "grid", justify = 'left', split.tables=Inf, caption = "Table 2. Policies included in the Extended National Policies scenario.")

```

<!-------------------------->
## Carbon Neutral Malaysia and Kuala Lumpur
<!-------------------------->
<!-------------------------->

**Carbon Neutral Malaysia and Kuala Lumpur:** Prior to COP26, Malaysia pledged to achieve carbon neutrality as early as 2050. Later in 2021, Kuala Lumpur committed to becoming a climate-neutral city by 2050. The Carbon Neutral Malaysia and Kuala Lumpur scenario represents the most economically efficient pathway to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 given the policies outlined in the scenarios described above. This pathway will be found using GCAM’s solving capabilities. The outcomes of this scenario will provide insight into the role that that KLCH can play in achieving carbon neutrality and additional measures that may need to be taken.

```

PNNL will assess outcomes at the city level. The Council-Led scenario encompasses only policies that can be implemented by KLCH, although the Integrated Approach scenario requires additional action at the national level. Therefore, PNNL will perform some country level analysis, with the primary focus remaining on Kuala Lumpur. 

The map to the right shows Kuala Lumpur's location within Malaysia.


<!-------------------------->
<!-------------------------->
## Temporal
<!-------------------------->
<!-------------------------->

Scenarios will be assessed up from the year 2015 to the year 2050, with the GCAM analysis conducted at five-year intervals within this range.

As illustrated above, GCAM will offer capacity for planning and decision-making in addition to MEA’s current capabilities. Benefits of GCAM and the integrated modeling approach include the following:

* **Climate change context:** Since GCAM integrates water and climate systems, it will provide a more nuanced analysis of Smart Grid pathways in the context of ongoing climate change. GCAM considers the bi-directional relationship between climate and energy: climate change impacts electricity demand and power system stability and reliability, while power generation contributes to climate change.
* **Long-term assessment:** GCAM will offer long-term projections of the impacts of Smart Grid technologies and policies, beyond the time frame already proposed in Thailand’s Smart Grid plan.
* **Technology analysis:** Using GCAM’s technology scenario capabilities, PNNL will be able to assess the impacts of specific technology implementations on electricity demand, generation, emissions, and prices far into the future.
* **Holistic approach:** GCAM analyzes the multi-sector impacts of policies and technologies, supporting the integration of MEA's Smart Grid development into the Smart City initiative. GCAM's holistic approach will provide insight into how MEA's Smart Grid plans fit within Thailand's broader goals for socioeconomic development and reduction of environmental impact.

These capabilities will enrich MEA's current capacity for grid planning and analyzing Smart City pathways.

<!-------------------------->
<!-------------------------->
## Key Indicators
<!-------------------------->
<!-------------------------->

The GCAM output for each scenario will include the following indicators calculated at 5-year timesteps through the year 2100 in the study region, as specified in the Spatial and Temporal Scope section.

```{r, results = 'show', eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(pander)
myTable = data.frame(
    Indicator = c("Electricity generation", 
                  "Installed power capacity",
                  "Energy demand",
                  "Final energy consumption",
                  "CO2 emissions",
                  "Electricity price",
                  "Transport service output"),
    Description = c("Amount of electricity generated (total & by generation technology",
                    "Power capacity of power plants (total & by generation technology",
                    "Amount of energy demanded (total & by sector",
                    "Amount of energy consumed (total & by sector",
                    "Amount of CO2 emitted (total & by sector",
                    "Price of electricity for consumer by sector",
                    "Output of each type of transportation"),
    Units = c("terawatt-hours (TWh)",
              "TWh",
              "Exajoules (EJ)",
              "EJ",
              "metric tons CO2 equivalent (MT CO2)",
              "US dollars ($USD)",
              "passenger-kilometers (pass-km)")
    ) 
pander::pander(myTable, keep.line.breaks = TRUE, style = "grid", justify = 'left', split.tables=Inf, caption = "Table 4. Key indicators reported for each scenario.")

```

<!-------------------------->
<!-------------------------->
## Model Results
<!-------------------------->
<!-------------------------->

PNNL will present GCAM results showing relevant outcomes of the modeled scenarios up to the year 2100. These results could include greenhouse gas emissions, energy supply and demand, electricity price, and technology penetration, among other indicators. PNNL will work with MEA to determine which indicators are the most important to consider when assessing the impact of Smart Grid policies and technologies. 

<!-------------------------->
<!-------------------------->
## Analysis and Recommendations
<!-------------------------->
<!-------------------------->

PNNL, in collaboration with MEA, will summarize and interpret the GCAM results for each policy pathway and impact indicator. This will include a discussion of how these results relate to MEA’s smart grid efforts and Bangkok’s current Smart City roadmaps and potential additional roadmaps. Based on the GCAM results, PNNL will provide recommendations for policy pathways that best meet the goals of MEA’s Smart Grid development while making the desired contributions to Thailand’s holistic Smart City and power development objectives. The process of analysis and recommendations will involve engagement and feedback from MEA as PNNL works to provide information that best addresses MEA’s planning needs.
